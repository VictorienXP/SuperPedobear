Meme flavoured hide and seek gamemode!
_Or also like Escape Pedobear but pvp with power-ups..._

By default you're playing as a hiding which need to escape from the seeker(s)  
The seekers are automatically chosen by the gamemode and it should be fair enough so everyone can play as a seeker

# Features
* More seekers will spawn when there are more players!
* Can be played on any map! (Best with PropHunt or dedicated `spb_` maps)
* Power-UPs!
* Stamina for the hiding!
* As a hiding you can use the playermodel you want!
* Third person mode!
* Spectator mode!
* Welding system for the hiding!
* Taunt system!
* Music player/Jukebox!
* Server owners can use the cvars and .json files to quickly configure/customize aspects of the gamemode!
* Map makers can use and place gamemode entities! [Check out the FGD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xperidia/SuperPedobear/master/superpedobear.fgd)

# Power-UPs
* [Hiding] **Clone**: Clone yourself to bait the seekers or hide your clone somewhere to respawn on it later!
* [Hiding] **Boost**: Gives 200% stamina!
* [Hiding] **Invisibility**: Makes you invisible and invulnerable to the seekers!
* [Seeker] **Radar**: Highlights all hidings for a limited time!
* [Seeker] **False Power-UP**: It's a trap!
